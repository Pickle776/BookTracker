# BookTracker

I wanted a way to track my books without the bloat. Most apps felt like social media or tried to "motivate" me with targets I didn't want. I built this simple, minimalist tool to solve that problem.

* It's free
* Automatic backup through Google Drive (no sign-in required)
* Simple enough for older users or minimalists
* No internet connection required
* Tags for Non-fiction, Owned, Youth, and Read status
* Supports multiple languages

Note: I used AI for some of the code, but the design and flow are mine. Feel free to offer constructive criticism.
